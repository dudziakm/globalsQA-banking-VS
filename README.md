# GlobalSQA Banking Application Test Automation

This project implements an automated testing framework for the [GlobalSQA Banking Application](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/) using Playwright with TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This test automation framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, providing a maintainable, scalable, and reliable way to test web applications. The framework is designed to test a demo banking application that includes customer and bank manager operations.

## Features

- **Page Object Model Architecture**: Clean separation of test logic and page interactions
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Headless Execution**: Tests run in headless mode for CI/CD integration
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated test execution on push and pull requests
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Customer and bank manager operations
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of test execution
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatic screenshot capture on test failures
- **Test Reporting**: HTML reports for test results

## Page Objects

The framework includes the following page objects:

- **BasePage**: Base class with common methods for all pages
- **LoginPage**: Handles login functionality
- **CustomerPage**: Manages customer operations (deposits, withdrawals, etc.)
- **ManagerPage**: Manages bank manager operations (adding customers, opening accounts, etc.)
- **TransactionsPage**: Handles transaction history functionality

## Tests

The test suite includes the following test cases:

### Customer Operations

- Customer login and logout
- Account operations
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- View transaction history

### Bank Manager Operations

- Add new customers
- Open new accounts
- Delete customers
- View customers list

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run tests in headed mode (with browser visible)

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Run specific test file

```bash
npx playwright test tests/banking/customer-login.spec.ts
```

### View test report

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow configuration to run tests automatically:

- Tests run on push to main/master branch
- Tests run on pull requests to main/master branch
- Test reports are uploaded as artifacts
- Only Chrome (Chromium) browser is used for testing

## Notes on Test Stability

The GlobalSQA Banking Application exhibits some inconsistent behaviors:

- Transaction history may not always display transactions
- Withdrawal operations may not always reduce balance as expected
- Error messages for invalid operations are not always consistent

The test framework has been designed to handle these inconsistencies gracefully, logging warnings instead of failing tests when the application behaves unexpectedly.

## Extending the Framework

### Adding new page objects

1. Create a new file in `src/pages/`
2. Extend the `BasePage` class
3. Implement page-specific methods and locators

### Adding new tests

1. Create a new file in `tests/banking/`
2. Import the required page objects and fixtures
3. Use the `test` object from fixtures to access page objects
4. Implement test logic using page object methods
